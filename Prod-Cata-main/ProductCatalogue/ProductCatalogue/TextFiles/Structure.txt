Program needs;
	Productclass.
		Contain productname, price and id.
			Should  automatically be given a unique id.  (GUID)

	List should be stored in a txt file in json format.
	Ability to remove a product.

	Add an old list of products into the new one. (- Have mistaken this one.)
		Thought we needed to add a whole different list into the list of the program.
